# Bug Fix: History Rollback on Stream Errors

## Issue

The application was experiencing persistent errors with the same tool call ID appearing across multiple requests:

```
APICallError [AI_APICallError]: No tool call found for function call output with call_id call_h3XHvxzjgdbfvaZXGwvitvtB.
```

The error would repeat even after clearing the error state, causing the application to be unusable.

## Root Cause

When the AI SDK stream encountered an error:

1. The `_runAgentLogic` function would start adding items to history (assistant message, tool requests)
2. If an error occurred during streaming or tool processing, the error handler would catch it
3. However, the partial history entries added during the failed attempt remained in state
4. On the next user request, these incomplete entries (assistant messages with tool calls but no results) would be sent back to the LLM
5. The AI SDK would see tool calls in the conversation history without corresponding tool results and throw an error

This created a cycle where:

- Error occurs → Partial history persists → Next request includes incomplete data → Error occurs again

## Solution

Implemented a **history rollback mechanism** that:

1. **Captures starting state**: Records the history length at the start of `_runAgentLogic`
2. **Monitors additions**: Allows normal history additions during execution
3. **Rolls back on error**: If any error occurs, removes all history items added since the start
4. **Preserves successful history**: Only rolls back items from the failed attempt

### Implementation

```typescript
_runAgentLogic: async (retryCount = 0) => {
    // Track starting point
    const startHistoryLength = get().history.length;

    try {
        // ... normal execution logic ...
    } catch (error) {
        // Rollback any partial additions
        const currentHistory = get().history;
        if (currentHistory.length > startHistoryLength) {
            logger.warn(`Rolling back ${currentHistory.length - startHistoryLength} history items due to error`);
            set({ history: currentHistory.slice(0, startHistoryLength) });
        }

        // ... error handling ...
    }
};
```

## Impact

This fix ensures:

1. **No stale tool calls**: Incomplete tool calls never persist in history
2. **Clean error recovery**: Each retry starts with a clean state
3. **Predictable behavior**: Users can retry failed requests without cascading errors
4. **Proper conversation flow**: History only contains complete request-response cycles

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Empty history**: Rollback works correctly even with no prior history
2. **Multiple items added**: Rolls back all items added during failed attempt
3. **Partial assistant message**: Removes incomplete assistant responses
4. **No additions before error**: Skip rollback if error occurs before history modifications
5. **Successful history preservation**: Only failed additions are removed

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite added in `tests/agent/historyRollbackBug.test.ts` covering:

- Basic rollback functionality
- Multiple item rollback
- Partial assistant message cleanup
- Stale tool call ID prevention
- Successful history preservation
- Edge cases (empty history, no additions, etc.)
