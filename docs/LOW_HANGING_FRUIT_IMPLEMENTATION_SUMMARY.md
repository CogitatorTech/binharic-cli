7. `git_branch_current` - Get current branch name
8. `git_branch_create` - Create new branches with optional checkout
9. `git_branch_switch` - Switch to different branches

**Files Created**:

- `src/agent/tools/definitions/git.ts` - All git tool implementations

- Comprehensive test coverage (18 tests)
- Truncation for large diffs (10KB limit)
- Full TypeScript typing with Zod schemas

**Testing**: ✅ All 18 git tool tests passing

---

### 2. **File Diff Tools** (Priority #3) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Effort**: Completed in session
**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH

**What Was Added**:

- Tools for comparing files and showing changes
- Integration with git and system diff command

**Tools Implemented**:

1. `diff_files` - Compare two files with unified diff format
2. `diff_show_changes` - Show uncommitted git changes for files

**Files Created**:

- `src/agent/tools/definitions/diff.ts`

**Key Features**:

- Configurable context lines (default: 3)
- Truncation for large diffs (15KB limit)
- Handles identical files gracefully
- Git integration for uncommitted changes

**Testing**: ✅ Compiles without errors

---

### 3. **Multi-File Read Tool** (Priority #8) ⭐⭐⭐

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Effort**: Completed in session
**Impact**: MEDIUM

**What Was Added**:

- Batch file reading capability (up to 20 files at once)
- Efficient context gathering for LLM

**Tool Implemented**:

1. `read_multiple_files` - Read multiple files with summary

**Files Created**:

- `src/agent/tools/definitions/multiRead.ts`

**Key Features**:

- Read up to 20 files in one operation
- Optional line numbers
- Per-file size limit (500KB)
- Error handling per file (doesn't fail entire operation)
- Summary showing success/error counts
- Clear file separators in output

**Testing**: ✅ Compiles without errors

---

### 4. **Enhanced Error Messages** (Priority #4) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Effort**: Completed in session
**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH

**What Was Added**:

- Intelligent suggestions for common TypeScript errors
- Context-aware error help

**Enhancement**:

- Enhanced existing `get_errors` tool with suggestion system

**Files Modified**:

- `src/agent/tools/definitions/getErrors.ts`

**Patterns Detected (10+)**:

1. Property doesn't exist → Check spelling, use optional chaining
2. Cannot find name → Check for typos, missing imports
3. Type mismatch → Conversion or type assertion suggestions
4. Object possibly null/undefined → Null checks, optional chaining
5. Argument type mismatch → Function signature guidance
6. Unused variable → Remove or prefix with underscore
7. Implicit any type → Add explicit type annotation
8. Wrong argument count → Function signature check
9. Module not found → Check path, npm install, file extensions
10. Await in non-async → Add async keyword

**Example Output**:

```
<compileError severity="ERROR" line="42" column="10">
Property 'foo' does not exist on type 'Bar'

💡 Suggestion: Check if property 'foo' is correctly spelled or if type 'Bar'
needs to be extended. Consider using optional chaining (?.) if the property
might not exist.
</compileError>
```

**Testing**: ✅ Compiles without errors

---

### 5. **Workflow Templates** (Priority #5) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Effort**: Completed in session
**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH

**What Was Added**:

- 4 predefined workflow templates for common tasks
- Step-by-step guidance in Mechanicus theme

**Templates Implemented**:

1. **`fix-bug`** - Read → Analyze → Edit → Test → Validate
2. **`add-feature`** - Create → Edit → Test → Validate → Document
3. **`refactor`** - Read → Analyze → Edit Multiple → Test → Validate
4. **`debug`** - Get Errors → Read Relevant → Fix → Validate

**Files Modified**:

- `src/agent/tools/definitions/workflow.ts`

**Key Features**:

- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Emoji-based visual hierarchy
- Thematic language (Omnissiah, machine spirits, etc.)
- Easy to extend with more templates
- Guides agent through complex multi-step tasks

**Example Output**:

```
🔧 FIX-BUG WORKFLOW TEMPLATE ACTIVATED

The Omnissiah guides your debugging ritual:

1. 📖 READ FILE: Use read_file to examine path/to/file.ts
2. 🔍 ANALYZE: Identify the bug and root cause
3. ✏️ EDIT: Use insert_edit_into_file to fix the issue
4. 🧪 TEST: Use run_in_terminal to run relevant tests
5. ✅ VALIDATE: Use validate or get_errors to confirm the fix

Proceed with step 1: Read the file to understand the code structure.
```

**Testing**: ✅ Compiles without errors

---

### 6. **Checkpoint System Integration** (Priority #2) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Effort**: Completed in session
**Impact**: HIGH (Safety & UX)

**What Was Added**:

- Full integration of existing checkpoint system
- UI component for user approval
- State management for checkpoint flow

**Components**:

1. Checkpoint state in app state machine
2. `confirmCheckpoint` and `rejectCheckpoint` actions
3. `checkpoint-request` status handling
4. UI integration in App.tsx

**Files Modified**:

- `src/agent/state.ts` - Added checkpoint state and actions
- `src/ui/App.tsx` - Integrated CheckpointConfirmation component

**Key Features**:

- Risk level assessment (low, medium, high, critical)
- Interactive approval/rejection with keyboard shortcuts
- Thematic UI with risk-appropriate colors and symbols
- Integration with tool execution flow
- Graceful rejection handling

**UI Example**:

```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ ⚠️  CRITICAL - Sacred Checkpoint Required    │
│                                              │
│ Operation: edit                              │
│ Target: package.json                         │
│ Description: Modifying critical config file  │
│                                              │
│ Press ENTER to grant the Omnissiah's        │
│ blessing | ESC to deny this operation       │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

**Testing**: ✅ UI compiles and renders correctly

---

## 🔧 Bug Fixes

### Test Cleanup Issue

**Problem**: Duplicate FileTracker tests in two files causing directory cleanup conflicts
**Solution**: Removed duplicate tests from `stateRaceCondition.test.ts`
**Result**: ✅ All 420 tests now passing

### Git Tools Mock Issue

**Problem**: Module-level `simpleGit()` call prevented proper test mocking
**Solution**: Moved `simpleGit()` calls inside each tool's execute function
**Result**: ✅ All 18 git tool tests passing

2. **Test Isolation**: Avoid duplicate test suites to prevent resource conflicts
3. **Incremental Features**: Small, well-tested additions are better than large refactors
4. **Theme Consistency**: Every feature can maintain the unique Mechanicus character
5. **Documentation**: Write docs while implementing for better context
